            <p>In 2000, due to increased need of medical services in several areas of upper part of Kabankalan City, City Mayor Isidro P. Zayco, initiate the plan to build a public hospital with thw noble purpose of providing practical but efficient health care services to the public.</p>
      <p> The initial plan was to buld the hospital in Barangay Tapi but it was not materialized due to unavailability if location and inadequate water supply.</p>
<p>SP Member Efren Anacan, SP Member Procopio Lescano and Dr. Isagano Ayala found a site in Barangay Tabugon. The construction was then started and the hospital was inaugurated on December 9, 2000 and the operation started December 11, 2000. It started with 32 personnel. There were 3 physicians, Dra. Evangelina Guanco was the Chief of Hospital. Nursing service has 7 midwives and 7 nurses under the supervision of Miss Patricia Ningal.</p>
<p>When the operation started, the hospital has no ambulance. During emergencies the hospital was using the ambulance of Central Dacongcogon. The hospital used candles and oil lamps in the event of blackout and power interruption. In the year 2004 the generator was installed. Previously, the main source of water supply was the Pinamulakan Water System. It was in 2006 when the deep well with reservoir tank was built. </p>
 <p> In 2003, the hospital was approved as a Philhealth Accredited Hospital. The hospital is licensed to function as 10-bed primary hospital with the following services: out-patient and in-patient services, emergency services, pharmacy services, dental services, medical records services and medical social services. In 2010, the hospital was authorized by the PHIC to provide Outpatient Benefit Package.</p>

The 2nd building was constructed that housed the wards, labor and delivery room, operating room and kitchen. On 2013, the third building for additional wards and isolation rooms were built together with the cadaver holding area, laundry and stock room.</p>
<p> Due to Covid-19 Pandemic that started 2019 the COvid-19 Community Isolation Unit was established to cater Covid-19 Positive patients.
